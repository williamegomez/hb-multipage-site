# hb-multipage-site

This exercise will help you to have a better understanding of the correct structure of a web project.

## Rules

In this exercise you should separate the user interface from any kind of business logic. For this you can use separate modules that are connected using dependencies (`import` and `export`).

Take into consideration the following global rules for all components / features:
- A separate branch should be created each time a new component or feature is implemented, and should only be merged into `master` using a Pull Request. Please add the Bootcamp Director to your repository so those PRs can be reviewed and merged. Branches should *NOT* be merged by the developer.
- Each component should have it's one folder.
- Each component should use the [pug-loader](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-loader) to read the template and generate HTML.
- Each component should be implemented using the mobile first approach.
- Each component should be responsive using the following viewports:
  - Small: 320px - 639px
  - Medium: 640px - 1023px
  - Large: 1024px - âˆž

## Components

### Main Menu
This component should be present on every page since it is a global component that helps the user to navigate between different pages.
